### Usage

 - If you do not have installed [doca](https://github.com/cloudflare/doca) you can just open the static file ``index.html`` which is in ``/documentation/build/``.

 - In case you have already installed [doca](https://github.com/cloudflare/doca), just go in ``/documentation`` run ``npm install`` to install all dependencies and then ``npm start`` which will start [doca](https://github.com/cloudflare/doca) on ``port 8000 ``and you could open it directly in the browser - ``http://localhost:8000``


**That's it!**
